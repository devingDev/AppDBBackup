#Backup your app.db


Hi you can backup and restore app.db

It saves the app.db from ur0:shell/db/app.db to ux0:data/appdbbackupper/backedup_app.db !

If you want to restore app.db with this app it has to find exactly that file on ux0 !!


TODO : 

- Backup old app.db on ur0 before restoring
- Add check for checksum after backing up or restoring and if it does not match restore old app.db
- ???
- Profit

Issues and complaints go on Github or Discord!

ByeO
